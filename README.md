# Work Test

## Preparation
Please prepare yourself by setting up an (light) development setup for a HTML / JavaScript / CSS page.
(Webpack, Gulp, etc.) This way we can start right away and make most of the session.

_Please bring your own laptop, if that isn't possible please have your setup available online or on USB dongle._

## PSD -> WEB
I would like to pair with you on the converting parts of the PSD (in this repo) to HTML.

## JavaScript
For the second part of the pairing session I would like to discuss and setup parts of the filter as (vaguely)
represented in the `filter` folder.
